NFT is the abbreviation for "Non-Fungible Token", which means "non-exchangeable token". The word token is described in the dictionary as a "sequence of digits or letters", among other things, but has a different meaning in the context of the NFTs. To better understand the concept: A ten euro bill is an exchangeable token. It can be replaced with other bills or coins and the value remains the same. However, not all cash coins or bills are interchangeable. Cash coins that are no longer produced and have a certain characteristic are not interchangeable and have their own value.

The block system allows all transactions to be traced, which makes data manipulation more difficult, since all blocks build on one another and the information is linked
